Function: galoissplittinginit
Section: number_fields
C-Name: galoissplittinginit
Prototype: GDG
Help: galoissplittinginit(P,{d}): Galois group over Q of the splitting field of
 P, for P integral, monic and irreducible or given by a nf structure. If d is given, it must be a multiple of the splitting field degree. The output is compatible with functions expecting a galoisinit structure.
Doc: compute the Galois group over $Q$ of the splitting field of $P$, that is the smallest field over which $P$ is totally split. $P$ is assumed to be integral, monic and irreducible; it can also be given by a \kbd{nf} structure. If $d$ is given, it must be a multiple of
 the splitting field degree. The output is compatible with functions expecting
 a \kbd{galoisinit} structure.
