Prototype: GDGD-1,L,DG
Help: nflist(G, {N}, {s = -1}, {F}): finds number fields (up to isomorphism)
 with Galois group of Galois closure isomorphic to G, and s complex places.

 If s = -1 (default) all signatures, s = -2 is identical to s = -1 except
 fields are separated by increasing number of complex places. If field F is
 specified (by a polynomial), gives only number fields having F as a subfield
 (or a resolvent field in the case of S3, Dl, A4, S4, F5, M21 and M42).

 The parameter N can be the following: a positive integer (absolute
 value of discriminant is N); a vector [a,b] (finds fields with absolute
 discriminant between a and b); a polynomial, in variable t say (regular
 extension of Q(t) with specified Galois group). If omitted
 (default), returns a few fields and F is ignored.
Doc: finds number fields (up to isomorphism) with Galois group of Galois
 closure isomorphic to $G$ with $s$ complex places. The number fields are given by polynomials. This function supports
 the following groups:

 \item degree $2$: $C_2=2T1$;

 \item degree $3$: $C_3=3T1$ and $S_3=3T2$;

 \item degree $4$: $C_4=4T1$, $V_4=4T2$, $D_4=4T3$, $A_4=4T4$, and $S_4=4T5$;

 \item degree $5$: $C_5=5T1$, $D_5=5T2$, $F_5 = M_{20}=5T3$, and $A_5=5T4$;

 \item degree $6$: $C_6=6T1$, $S_3(6) = D_6(6)=6T2$, $D_6(12)=6T3$,
 $A_4(6)=6T4$, $S_3\times C_3=6T5$, $A_4(6)\times C_2=6T6$, $S_4(6)^+=6T7$,
 $S_4(6)^-=6T8$, $S_3^2=6T9$, $C_3^2:C_4=6T10$, $S_4(6)\times C_2=6T11$,
 $A_5(6)=PSL_2(5)=6T12$, and $C_3^2:D_4=6T13$;

 \item degree $7$: $C_7=7T1$, $D_7=7T2$, $M_{21}=7T3$, and $M_{42}=7T4$;

 \item degree $9$: $C_9=9T1$, $C_3\times C_3=9T2$, and $D_9=9T3$;

 \item degree $\ell$ with $\ell$ prime: $C_\ell=\ell T1$ and $D_\ell=\ell T2$.

 The groups $A_5$ and $A_5(6)$ require the optional package \kbd{nflistdata}.

 In addition, if $N$ is a polynomial, all transitive subgroups of $S_n$
 with $n\le 15$, as well as alternating groups $A_n$ and the full symmetric group
 $S_n$ for all $n$ (see below for details and explanations).

 The groups are coded as $[n,k]$ using the \kbd{nTk} format where $n$ is the
 degree and $k$ is the $T$-number, the index in the classification of
 transitive subgroups of $S_n$.

 Alternatively, the groups $C_n$, $D_n$,
 $A_n$, $S_n$, $V_4$, $F_5 = M_{20}$, $M_{21}$ and $M_{42}$ can be input as
 character strings exactly as written, lifting subscripts; for instance
 \kbd{"S4"} or \kbd{"M21"}. If the group is not recognized or is
 unsupported the function raises an exception.

 The number fields are computed on the fly (and not from a preexisting table)
 using a variety of algorithms, with the exception of $A_5$ and $A_5(6)$ which
 are obtained by table lookup.
 The algorithms are recursive and use the following ingredients: build
 distinguished subfields (or resolvent fields in Galois closures) of smaller
 degrees, use class field theory to build abelian extensions over a known
 base, select subfields using Galois theory. Because of our use of class
 field theory, and ultimately \kbd{bnfinit}, all results depend on the GRH in
 degree $n > 3$.

 To avoid wasting time, the output polynomials defining the number fields are
 usually not the simplest possible, use \kbd{polredbest} or \kbd{polredabs}
 to reduce them.

 The non-negative integer $s$ specifies the number of complex places, between
 $0$ and $n/2$. Additional supported values are:

 \item $s = -1$ (default) all signatures;

 \item $s = -2$ all signatures, given by increasing number of complex
 places; in degree $n$, this means a vector with $1 + \text{floor}(n/2)$
 components: the $i$-th entry corresponds to $s = i - 1$.

 If the irreducible monic polynomial $F\in \Z[X]$ is specified, gives only
 number fields having $\Q[X]/(F)$ as a subfield, or in the case of
 $S_3$, $D_\ell$, $A_4$, $S_4$, $F_5$, $M_{21}$ and $M_{42}$, as a resolvent
 field (see also the function \kbd{nfresolvent} for these cases).

 The parameter $N$ can be the following:

 \item a positive integer: finds all fields with absolute discriminant $N$
 (recall that the discriminant over $\Q$ is $(-1)^s N$).

 \item a pair of non-negative real numbers $[a,b]$ specifying a real interval:
 finds all fields with absolute value of discriminant between $a$ and $b$.
 For most Galois groups, this is faster than iterating on individual $N$.

 \item omitted (default): a few fields of small discriminant (not always
 those with smallest absolute discriminant) are output with given $G$
 and $s$; usually about 10, less if too difficult to find. The parameter
 $F$ is ignored.

 \item a polynomial with main variable, say $t$, of priority lower than $x$.
 The program outputs a \emph{regular} polynomial in $\Q(t)[x]$ (in fact in
 $\Z[x,t]$) with the given Galois group. By Hilbert irreducibility, almost all
 specializations of $t$ will give suitable polynomials. The parameters $s$ and
 $F$ are ignored. This is implemented for all transitive subgroups of
 $S_n$ with $n\le15$ as well as for the alternating and symmetric groups $A_n$ and
 $S_n$ for all $n$. Polynomials for $A_n$ were inspired by J.-F.~Mestre,
 a few polynomials in degree $\leq 8$ come from G.~W.~Smith,
 ``Some polynomials over $\Q(t)$ and their
 Galois groups'', \emph{Math. Comp.}, {\bf 69} (230), 1999, pp.~775--796
 most others in degree $\leq 11$ were provided by J.~Kl\"uners and G.~Malle
 (see G.~Malle and B.~H.~Matzat, \emph{Inverse Galois Theory}, Springer,
 1999) and T.~Dokchitser completed the list up to degree~$15$. But for
 $A_n$ and $S_n$, subgroups of $S_n$ for $n > 7$ require the optional
 \kbd{nflistdata} package.

 \misctitle{Complexity} : For a positive integer $N$, the complexity is
 subexponential in $\log N$ (and involves factoring $N$). For an interval
 $[a,b]$, the complexity is roughly as follows, ignoring terms which are
 subexponential in $\log b$. It is usually linear in the output size.

 \item $C_n$: $O(b^{1/\phi(n)})$ for $n = 2, 4, 6, 9$ or any odd prime;

 \item $D_n$: $O(b^{2/\phi(n)})$ for $n = 4$ or any odd prime;

 \item $V_4$, $A_4$: $O(b^{1/2})$, $S_4$: $O(b)$;
 N.B. The subexponential terms are expensive for $A_4$ and $S_4$.

 \item $M_{20}$: $O(b)$.

 \item $S_4(6)^-$, $S_4(6)^+$ $A_4(6)\times C_2$, $S_3\times S_3$,
 $S_4(6)\times C_2$ : $O(b)$,
 $D_6(12)$, $A_4(6)$, $S_3(6)$, $S_3\times C_3$, $C_3^2:C_4$: $O(b^{1/2})$.

 \item $M_{21}$, $M_{42}$: $O(b)$.

 \item $C_3\times C_3$: $O(b^{1/3})$, $D_9$: $O(b^{5/12})$.
