Help: lambertw(y,{branch=0}): solution of the implicit equation x*exp(x)=y.
 In the p-adic case, give a solution of x*exp(x)=y if x has positive
 valuation, of x+log(x)=log(y) otherwise.
Doc: Lambert $W$ function, solution of the implicit equation $xe^x=y$.

 \item For real inputs $y$:
 If \kbd{branch = 0}, principal branch $W_0$ defined for $y\ge-\exp(-1)$.
 If \kbd{branch = -1}, branch $W_{-1}$ defined for $-\exp(-1)\le y<0$.

 \item For $p$-adic inputs: give a solution of $x\exp(x)=y$ if $x$ has
 positive valuation, of $x+\log(x)=\log(y)$ otherwise.

 \misctitle{Caveat}
 Complex values of $y$ are also supported but experimental. The other
 branches $W_k$ for $k$ not equal to $0$ or $-1$ (set \kbd{branch} to $k$)
 are also experimental.

 For $k\ge1$, $W_{-1-k}(x)=\overline{W_k(x)}$, and $\Im(W_k(x))$ is
 close to $(\pi/2)(4k-\text{sign}(x))$.
