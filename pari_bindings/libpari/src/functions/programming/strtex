Help: strtex({x}*): translates its (string) arguments to TeX format and
 returns the resulting string.
Doc:
 translates its arguments to TeX format, and concatenates the results into a
 single character string (type \typ{STR}, the empty string if $x$ is omitted).

 The individual arguments are read in string context, see \secref{se:strings}.
 \bprog
 ? v = [1, 2, 3]
 %1 [1, 2, 3]
 ? strtex(v)
 %2 = "\\pmatrix{ 1&2&3\\cr}\n"

 \misctitle{\TeX-nical notes} The TeX output engine was originally written
 for plain TeX and designed for maximal portability. Unfortunately later
 \kbd{LaTeX} packages have obsoleted valid \TeX\ primitives, leading us
 to replace TeX's \kbd{\bs{}over} by LaTeX's \kbd{\bs{}frac} in PARI's TeX
 output. We have decided not to update further our TeX markup and let the
 users of various LaTeX engines customize their preambles. The following
 documents the precise changes you may need to include in your style files to
 incorporate PARI TeX output verbatim:

 \item if you enabled bit 4 in \tet{TeXstyle} default, you must define
 \kbd{\bs{}PARIbreak}; see \kbd{??TeXstyle};

 \item if you use plain TeX only: you must define \kbd{\bs{}frac} as follows
 \bprog
   \def\frac#1#2{{#1\over#2}}
 @eprog

 \item if you use LaTeX and \kbd{amsmath}, \kbd{\bs{}pmatrix} is
 obsoleted in favor of the \kbd{pmatrix} environment; see
 \kbd{examples/parigp.sty} for how to re-enable the deprecated construct.
